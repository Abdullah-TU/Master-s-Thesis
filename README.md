## Thesis Topic:
### Map out the best BI tool and SPC software for a case company: selection and rationalization process.


## File: BI tools and SPC software evaluation and calculations.xlsx
This file will show how we have completed our calculation method, formulas we have used and so on.

We have used Excel and Python programming to map out BI and SPC tools. However, In Excel, we have included a detailed criteria map (including sub-sections), scoring pro-cedures, and calculation formulas in the BI tools sheet. All the scoring and calculations are there. Firstly, we scored each tool according to each criterion and used the formula to get the final weighted score for each tool. We scored all the subsections in the BI and got the total score back to the BI calculation sheet to find the final weighted score.
Similarly, all the scoring and calculations of SPC software are on the SPC sheet. Firstly, we scored each tool according to each criterion and used the formula to get the final weighted score for each tool. We scored all the subsections in the SPC subsections and got the total score back to the SPC calculation sheet to find the final weighted score 



## File: Evaluation of the best BI tools.ipynb & Evaluation of the best SPC softwares.ipynb

We used the python programming language to calculate and map out BI and SPC soft-ware, especially since it is impossible to calculate the efficacies of several sub-sections. Please see the details and visualisations in the file.
