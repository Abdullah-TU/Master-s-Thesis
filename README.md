### Map out the best BI tool and SPC software for a case company: selection and rationalization process.

## ABSTRACT:
The Business intelligence (BI) is about delivering relevant and reliable information to the right people at the right time to achieve better decisions faster. To do this, BI requires methods and programs to collect unstructured data, convert it into information, and present it to improve busi-ness decisions. There are many types of BI tools available on the market that perform these tasks. On the other hand, statistical process control (SPC) is used to control the process with the help of statistical tools and techniques. It helps to monitor and control the process, reduce variations in the process, improve product quality, and so on. In this thesis, our main goal is to find the best BI tools and SPC software for the Finland-based automobile manufacturing company Valmet Au-tomotive.
Valmet Automotive is one of the world's top producers of automobiles and batteries. The or-ganization uses BI and SPC tools for data analysis, visualization, and processing. Nonetheless, businesses confronted challenges in employing these instruments at various periods. We started this thesis to find possible BI and SPC technologies for the organization so that we could solve this problem.
Every software must satisfy ISO 9000-3. It is an international software development and quality assurance guideline. Furthermore, every software must maintain ISO-9126. ISO-9126 is a quality model that determines the evaluation of software quality. Our software selection processes are based on ISO 9000-3 and ISO-9126.
Our first goal was to find the best BI tools and SPC software for the organization based on their specific needs. Therefore, to map out potential BI and SPC tools, we have picked 30 BI tools and 13 SPC software from the huge amount of similar software in the market. At this point, we organized all the needed map-out criteria and software names in Excel, evaluated each tool on a scale of 5 for each criterion, and used math to get the total weighted score for each tool.
Furthermore, mathematical computation methods were used to complete the procedure. After completing the whole procedure in Excel, we enlisted the assistance of the code. Consequently, the Python programming language was used to calculate the overall score. After computation, using Python visualization libraries, we identified the top five BI tools out of thirty and the top three SPC tools out of thirteen SPC software. In the case study, we also found the best BI tool and SPC software for the company by using visualizations. In the findings, Microsoft Power BI was the best BI tool, and SPC for Excel was the best SPC software for the case company. Therefore, the case company, Valmet Automotive chose Microsoft Power BI as its leading BI solution.
Mostly, our methods and calculations are done for the case company's best tool selection. However, in the future, any company that needs good quality BI tools or SPC software can follow our methodology and calculation methods to select the best BI tools and SPC software available on the market at that time for their needs.

## File: BI tools and SPC software evaluation and calculations.xlsx
This file will show how we have completed our calculation method, formulas we have used and so on.

We have used Excel and Python programming to map out BI and SPC tools. However, In Excel, we have included a detailed criteria map (including sub-sections), scoring pro-cedures, and calculation formulas in the BI tools sheet. All the scoring and calculations are there. Firstly, we scored each tool according to each criterion and used the formula to get the final weighted score for each tool. We scored all the subsections in the BI and got the total score back to the BI calculation sheet to find the final weighted score.
Similarly, all the scoring and calculations of SPC software are on the SPC sheet. Firstly, we scored each tool according to each criterion and used the formula to get the final weighted score for each tool. We scored all the subsections in the SPC subsections and got the total score back to the SPC calculation sheet to find the final weighted score 

## File: Evaluation of the best BI tools.ipynb & Evaluation of the best SPC softwares.ipynb

We used the python programming language to calculate and map out BI and SPC soft-ware, especially since it is impossible to calculate the efficacies of several sub-sections. Please see the details and visualisations in the file.
